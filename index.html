    <h2>Types of Solar Storms:</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Solar Flare - </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="bigbreak">Solar Flare's are a billow of radiation and an excessive amount of energy that is sent soaring in space, this storm can sweep up protons along is way creating a proton storm.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>CME's or Coronal Mass Ejection - </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="bigbreak">CME's or Coronal Mass Ejections launch billions of tons of plasma into space, this riptide in space can reach up to 9 million km/h.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Super Solar Storm - </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="bigbreak">A Super Solar Storm happens once or twice every century. Early signs of these storms are powerful solar flares before a forceful CME which results in a thunder. The CME contains millions of tons of boiling plasma. The CME crosses the 150 million km gap between us and the sun within a day. When this CME arrives it generates a shockwave that vigorously wedges the earth's magentic field abd transfers energy into the magentosphere. If and when the CNE's magnetic field aligns with the earth's then both fields can combine, as the magnetic cloud passes over earth it stretches earth's magnetic field into a long tail like shape. When this energy that is in the tail is too much to sustain it snaps and erupts towards earth. This eruption towards earth is called a geomagnetic storm.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Super Flares - </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="bigbreak">This type of solar storm can occur every few millenniums, the eruptions and magnitude from this type of storms are far more powerful than any storm we have studied or seen before.</p>

  <h2>Affect on Earth (by section of storm): </h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>Affects on Earth by a Solar Flare or CME - </h3>
  <br>
  <p class="bigbreak">Solar Flares or CMEs cannot touch us on earth because of our amazing atmosphere, one layer in our atmosphere called the stratosphere contains the ozone layer. The ozone layer protects us from these type of solar storms and harmful UV rays. These storms may have an affect on satellites and astronauts and maybe navigation but not on us.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Affects on Earth by a Super Solar Storm - </h3>
  <br>
  <p class="bigbreak">Due to our machinery and development in the 21st century, these powerful storms have a large affect on us. As said above in the explanation electricity can create magnetic fields and vice versa, our machinery and electricity will be largely affected by this storm. This type of storm could cost us trillions and years to rebuild our machinery and elctricity systems.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Affects on Earth by a Super Flare - </h3>
  <br>
  <p class="bigbreak">Since a Super Flare is even more powerful than a Super Solar Storm that means not only will it have the same effects that a Super Solar Storm will have on us because of our modern technology, it will cost us even more money and time to repair our machinery. The power of this storm is enough to cut of supplies and chains we use everyday, like water and hospital supplies. It will most likely take somewhere up to 10 trillion and decades to rebuild our creations.</p>

  <h2>Solutions and Prevention Methods: </h2>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p class="bigbreak">Due to our modern technology and systems, scientists that observe the sun's behavior will have plenty of time to respond and prevent these powerful storms to cost us trillions in damage and time. And engineers who create and sustain our systems will have time to unplug the systems we use daily, so that our electricity and machinery cannot be largely affected. The only way to prevent any solar storm from damaging our society is to stay prepared.</p>
